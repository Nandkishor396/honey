     </h5>Very Awesome
	   <p>The story of ambitious Rocky’s partial journey towards power and riches. The story is told in a non linear format which travels to and fro between 1951 to 2018.   The film wastes no time and picks up steam from the word go. The first half episodes build the character of Rocky and establishes him has a powerful maverick don. It breezes to the interval with its share of cliche punchlines, multiple hero elevations, goose bumps and item song i.e. typical commercial format story telling but with lots of style and swag.

It is in the second half when Rocky enters the Dark Dangerous world of KGF the film further elevates and transforms into cinematic glory of epic proportions. Director Prashant transports us into a total different world of slaves, atrocities and marauding army of warlords. The visuals are of world standards and some scenes leave you spell bound. The film ends with a twist and leaves you yearning for the part 2. 

The movie is Karnataka’s contribution to the pan India audience and director Prashanth leaves no stone unturned in making it a master piece. His vision has been told with utmost conviction and clarity. This movie sets a precedent for the upcoming Kannada movies and new local talents to dream big. Prashant’s  screenplay and multi layered story telling keeps you engaged without a moment of dullness in the movie. I liked the way he has inserted Rocky’s mother episodes throughout the movie. You can easily call him Kannada’s Rajamouli. 

Yash as Rocky gets into the skin of the role with ease. He is the principal character and is present in 80% of the movie. He sets the screen on fire with his blazing screen presence, dialogues, fights and style. I would say this is his career best performance til date. Shreenidhi looks fresh but very little role to offer. The kid who acted as junior rocky is fantastic. There is a long list of new villains who all perform well and are presented effectively, special mention to guy who played Garuda character. Anant nag as a narrator is adept. Should say the entire casting is perfect. 

All technical departments have done their part with finesse to enhance the movie to another level. Cinematography by Bhuvan, artwork by Shivu, BGM by Ravi Basrur and costume designing are exceptional. The sets are huge and CG extensions look very realistic and of great quality. Brilliant colour grading gives that extra feel to connect to the period and geography. Editing in certain fight scenes were a little cluttered but overall good. 

Hats off to the producer for his guts. 

Though the movie has its minor flaws in some places it is nullified by the fast pace and engaging story telling. 

Overall a fabulous movie to be watched only in theatres. If you watch it online or on television the essence and feel will be lost. A film not to be missed at all. I watched it in Kannada. Options available in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam.</p>

          <p class="p_modal">Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone Book Review

Author : J.K Rowling
No. of Chapters : 17
Genre : Fantasy

If you want to know why series is so popular , just read this book and you’ll know.

Summary : The book is about an eleven year old British kid named Harry Potter who has no idea that he is a wizard and is destined to learn magic at a wizardry school . It’s just a beginning of an incredible and magical journey.

This book mainly contributes towards the world building . It’s suitable for almost every age group and you’re going to love it no matter how old you are. I had watched the movies before I started reading the books and I think that the books are a lot better than the films . With the books you just dive into the wizarding world but in the movies you just watch it on the screen. The world building is amazing and every bit of this world feels real….Hogwarts , Quidditch , Diagon Alley , Hogwarts Express and much more !

SPOILERS AHEAD !!!

I just love all the lead characters in this book ….Harry ,Ron , Harmonie , Hagrid , McGonnagal and of course , Snape . All the battles , The Mirror of Erised , Voldemort , Centuars …everything is just perfect. The best part of this series is the life in Hogwarts . Every time I read these books I feel to go there and just hang around. And there are these amazing characters that include Ron , a true and loyal friend , Harmonie , a bossy , smart and a true friend , and of course, Harry who gets all the love and friendship which had been denied to him for all those years before he joined Hogwarts. Hagrid is my favorite character in this book and is a pure jewel of Hogwarts . Even though Harry’s parents are dead he probably doesn’t realize just how much love he gets from Hagrid . There are many father figures to Harry throughout the series but hagrid and Dumbledore are the only father figures in this book .
I love the way the story unravels itself . It starts from just a normal eleven year old boy and leads to the reveal of the big bad of the wizarding world . The trio’s journey of finding out who wants the philosopher’s stone and each character using the skill they’re good at to go ahead is perfect . The hype that is built about Voldemort is paid off at the end and the reveal is completely unexpected ( not for me cuz I had already watched the movie ). Now let me talk about thing that just doesn’t make sense , the only way of Voldemort getting the Philosopher’s stone is when someone who needs the stone and doesn’t want to use it looks into the mirror of Erised . So if harry hadn’t gone to stop Voldemort , he wouldn’t have gotten the stone anyway. So that’s a small plot hole but the whole journey is extremely enjoyable so I don’t hate the book just because of this.
So wrapping up this incredibly long review , this book has amazing characters , awesome plot , Unexpected reveals , incredible world building . A Must read if you want to start a magical and a highly enjoyable series. This is just the beginning …..
